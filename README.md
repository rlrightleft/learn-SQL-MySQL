## About This Repo
**SQL Dialect:** MySQL

This is a personal learning archive where I document my solutions and reflections for exercises on **SQL platforms like SQLZoo and HackerRank**. Each file contains the original SQL exercise (paraphrased if required), my solutions, and comments explaining the logic and key takeaways.

All solutions are ðŸ’¯ correct at the time of upload and include explanations to reinforce key SQL topics like queries, joins, subqueries, and more.

## SQL Topics Covered
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, aggregate functions
- `JOIN` (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`)
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window Functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`, etc.)
- `CASE` statements, handling `NULL`, filtering, and more
