## About This Repo
**SQL Dialect:** MySQL

This is a personal learning archive where I document solutions and reflections from **SQL platforms like SQLZoo and HackerRank**. Each file contains the original SQL exercise (paraphrased if required), my solutions, and comments explaining the logic and key takeaways.

All solutions are 💯 correct at the time of upload and include explanations to reinforce key SQL topics like queries, joins, subqueries, and more.

---

## SQL Topics Covered
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, aggregate functions
- `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window Functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`, etc.)
- `CASE` statements, handling `NULL`, filtering, and more

## Current Sources

- [`sqlzoo/`](./sqlzoo/) — Solutions to all SQLZoo tutorials and quizzes  
- [`hackerrank/`](./hackerrank/) — Paraphrased HackerRank challenges + solutions (in progress)

## Why SQLZoo?
[SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) is a hands-on, beginner-friendly platform that helps you learn SQL from the ground up using real-world examples.  

I started with SQLZoo because of its structured progression and engaging challenges.
