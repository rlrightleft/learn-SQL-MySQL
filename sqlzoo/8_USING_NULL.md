# SQLZoo Solutions: Using NULL

This document contains my solutions to the SQLZoo ['Using NULL' section](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Using_Null) using MySQL syntax, along with my personal learning notes and explanations.

---

## Problem 1
List the teachers who have NULL for their department.  
Why we cannot use =  
You might think that the phrase `dept=NULL` would work here but it doesn't - you can use the phrase `dept IS NULL`.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL;
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `IS NULL` to filter null values in SQL.  
In SQL, `NULL` is not the same as a value of `0`.  
> From Wikipedia:  
> "A null should not be confused with a value of 0. A null indicates a lack of a value, which is not the same as a zero value.  
> In SQL, null is a marker, not a value.  
> This usage is quite different from most programming languages, where a null value of a reference means it is not pointing to any object."

## Problem 2
Note the `INNER JOIN` misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher 
  INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

---

## Problem 3
Use a different `JOIN` so that all teachers are listed.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
  LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

**My Notes:**  
`LEFT JOIN` includes all teachers, even those without a department.

---

## Problem 4
Use a different `JOIN` so that all departments are listed.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
  RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

**My Notes:**  
`RIGHT JOIN` ensures all departments are listed, even if they have no teachers.

---

## Problem 5
Use `COALESCE` to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  teacher.name,
  COALESCE(teacher.mobile, '07986 444 2266') AS 'mobile number'
FROM teacher;
```

**My Notes:**  
`COALESCE()` returns the first non-null value from its arguments.

---

## Problem 6
Use the `COALESCE` function and a `LEFT JOIN` to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  teacher.name, 
  COALESCE(dept.name, 'None') AS 'department name'
FROM teacher
  LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

---

## Problem 7
Use `COUNT` to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(teacher.name),
  COUNT(teacher.mobile)
FROM teacher;
```

---

## Problem 8
Use `COUNT` and `GROUP BY dept.name` to show each department and the number of staff. Use a `RIGHT JOIN` to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
  dept.name,
  COUNT(teacher.name)
FROM teacher
  RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
GROUP BY dept.name;
```

---

## Problem 9
Use `CASE` to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
  teacher.name,
  (CASE 
    WHEN dept IN (1, 2) THEN 'Sci'
    ELSE 'Art' 
    END) AS 'Sci or Art'
FROM teacher;
```

**My Notes:**  
`CASE` allows you to return different values under different conditions.

---

## Problem 10
Use `CASE` to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
  teacher.name,
  (CASE
    WHEN dept IN (1, 2) THEN 'Sci'
    WHEN dept = 3 THEN 'Art'
    ELSE 'None'
  END) AS 'Sci, Art, or None'
FROM teacher;
```
