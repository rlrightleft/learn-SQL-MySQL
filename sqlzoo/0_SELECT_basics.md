# SQLZoo Solutions: SELECT Basics

This document contains my solutions to the SQLZoo ['SELECT Basics' section](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics) using MySQL syntax, along with my personal learning notes and explanations.

## Problem 1
The example uses a `WHERE` clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings should be in 'single quotes';  
Modify it to show the population of Germany.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT population 
FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany';
```

**My Notes:**  
Strings should be in `'single quotes'` to distinguish them from SQL keywords or column names.

## Problem 2
Checking a list The word `IN` allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.  
Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT name, population 
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `IN` for a list — great for matching multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.  
Separate items using a comma `,`.

## Problem 3
Which countries are not too small and not too big? `BETWEEN` allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT name, area 
FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `BETWEEN ... AND` for an inclusive range — includes both boundary values.
