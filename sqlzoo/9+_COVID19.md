# SQLZoo Solutions: COVID-19 Window Functions (LAG)

This document contains my solutions to the SQLZoo ['Window LAG' (COVID-19 Data) section](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Window_LAG) using MySQL syntax, along with my personal learning notes and explanations.

---

## Problem 1
The example uses a `WHERE` clause to show the cases in 'Italy' in March 2020.  
Modify the query to show data from Spain.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  name, DAY(whn), confirmed, deaths, recovered
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Spain'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;
```

---

## Problem 2
The `LAG` function is used to show data from the preceding row or the table. When lining up rows the data is partitioned by country name and ordered by the data whn. That means that only data from Italy is considered.  
Modify the query to show confirmed for the day before.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  DAY(whn),
  confirmed,
  LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn) AS 'day_before'
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;
```

---

## Problem 3
The number of confirmed case is cumulative - but we can use `LAG` to recover the number of new cases reported for each day.  
Show the number of new cases for each day, for Italy, for March.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  name, DAY(whn), 
  (
  confirmed - LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn)
  ) AS new_cases
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;
```

**My Notes:**  
`LAG()` allows comparing to the previous row's confirmed cases.

---

## Problem 4
The data gathered are necessarily estimates and are inaccurate. However by taking a longer time span we can mitigate some of the effects.  
You can filter the data to view only Monday's figures `WHERE WEEKDAY(whn) = 0`.  
Show the number of new cases in Italy for each week in 2020 - show Monday only.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  name, 
  DATE_FORMAT(whn,'%Y-%m-%d') AS date, 
  (
  confirmed - LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn)
  ) AS new_cases
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND WEEKDAY(whn) = 0 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;
```

**My Notes:**  
Filter with `WEEKDAY(whn) = 0` to get Monday's data.

---

## Problem 5
You can `JOIN` a table using `DATE` arithmetic. This will give different results if data is missing.  
Show the number of new cases in Italy for each week - show Monday only.  
In the sample query we `JOIN` this week tw with last week lw using the `DATE_ADD` function.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  tw.name, 
  DATE_FORMAT(tw.whn,'%Y-%m-%d') AS date, 
  (tw.confirmed - lw.confirmed) AS new_cases_each_week
FROM covid tw 
  LEFT JOIN covid lw 
    ON DATE_ADD(lw.whn, INTERVAL 1 WEEK) = tw.whn 
    AND tw.name = lw.name
WHERE tw.name = 'Italy'
AND WEEKDAY(tw.whn) = 0
ORDER BY tw.whn;
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `JOIN` with `DATE_ADD()` to compare weekly data.

## Problem 6
This query shows the number of confirmed cases together with the world ranking for cases for the date '2020-04-20'. The number of COVID deaths is also shown.  
United States has the highest number, Spain is number 2...  
Notice that while Spain has the second highest confirmed cases, Italy has the second highest number of deaths due to the virus.  
Add a column to show the ranking for the number of deaths due to COVID.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  confirmed,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY confirmed DESC) rc,
  deaths,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY deaths DESC) deaths_rank
FROM covid
WHERE whn = '2020-04-20'
ORDER BY confirmed DESC;
```

---

## Problem 7
This query includes a `JOIN` to the world table so we can access the total population of each country and calculate infection rates (in cases per 100,000). 
   
Show the infection rate ranking for each country. Only include countries with a population of at least 10 million.

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
   world.name,
   ROUND(100000 * confirmed / population, 2) rate,
   RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rate) rank
FROM covid 
  JOIN world ON covid.name = world.name
WHERE whn = '2020-04-20' 
AND population > 10000000
ORDER BY population DESC;
```

**My Notes:**  
Calculate infection rates using population data from the world table (`JOIN`).

---

## Problem 8
For each country that has had at last 1000 new cases in a single day, show the date of the peak number of new cases.  

**My Solution:**
