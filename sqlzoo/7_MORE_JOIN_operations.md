# SQLZoo Solutions: More JOIN operations

This document contains my solutions to the SQLZoo ['More JOIN operations' section](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/More_JOIN_operations) using MySQL syntax, along with my personal learning notes and explanations.

## Problem 1
List the films where the yr is 1962. Show id, title.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT id, title
FROM movie 
WHERE yr = 1962;
```

---

## Problem 2
Give year of 'Citizen Kane'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT yr
FROM movie
WHERE title = 'Citizen Kane';
```

---

## Problem 3
List all of the Star Trek movies, include the id, title and yr (all of these movies include the words Star Trek in the title). Order results by year.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, yr
FROM movie
WHERE title LIKE '%Star Trek%'
ORDER BY yr;
```

---

## Problem 4
What id number does the actor 'Glenn Close' have?  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT id
FROM actor
WHERE name = 'Glenn Close';
```

---

## Problem 5
What is the id of the film 'Casablanca'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT id
FROM movie
WHERE title = 'Casablanca';
```

---

## Problem 6
Obtain the cast list for 'Casablanca'.  
what is a cast list?  
The cast list is the names of the actors who were in the movie.  
Use `movieid=11768`, (or whatever value you got from the previous question).  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT actor.name
FROM actor
  JOIN casting ON (actor.id = casting.actorid)
WHERE casting.movieid = 11768;
```

**My Notes:**  
`JOIN` allows us to retrieve all actors associated with the movie ID 11768 (Casablanca).

---

## Problem 7
Obtain the cast list for the film 'Alien'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT actor.name
FROM actor
  JOIN casting ON (actor.id = actorid)
WHERE movieid =
  (
  SELECT id
  FROM movie
  WHERE title = 'Alien'
  );
```

**My Notes:**  
Use a *subquery* to find the movie ID dynamically.

---

## Problem 8
List the films in which 'Harrison Ford' has appeared.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movie
  JOIN casting ON (movie.id = movieid)
WHERE actorid =
  (
  SELECT id
  FROM actor
  WHERE name = 'Harrison Ford'
  );
```

---

## Problem 9
List the films where 'Harrison Ford' has appeared - but not in the starring role. Note: the ord field of casting gives the position of the actor. If `ord=1` then this actor is in the starring role.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movie
  JOIN casting ON (movie.id = movieid)
WHERE ord > 1 
AND actorid =
  (
  SELECT id
  FROM actor
  WHERE name = 'Harrison Ford'
  );
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `ord > 1` to exclude lead roles while still listing supporting roles.

---

## Problem 10
List the films together with the leading star for all 1962 films.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT movie.title, actor.name
FROM casting
  JOIN movie ON (movieid = movie.id)
  JOIN actor ON (actorid = actor.id)
WHERE yr = 1962
AND ord = 1;
```

**My Notes:**  
You can `JOIN` more than 2 tables.

---

## Problem 11
Which were the busiest years for 'Rock Hudson', show the year and the number of movies he made each year for any year in which he made more than 2 movies.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT yr, COUNT(title) 
FROM movie 
  JOIN casting ON movie.id = movieid
  JOIN actor ON actorid = actor.id
WHERE name = 'Rock Hudson'
GROUP BY yr
HAVING COUNT(title) > 2;
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `HAVING` to filter years where Rock Hudson acted in more than 2 films.

---

## Problem 12
List the film title and the leading actor for all of the films 'Julie Andrews' played in.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT movie.title, actor.name
FROM casting
  JOIN movie ON (movieid = movie.id)
  JOIN actor ON (actorid = actor.id)
WHERE ord = 1
AND movie.id IN
  (SELECT movieid 
  FROM casting
  WHERE actorid = 
     (
    SELECT id
    FROM actor
    WHERE name = 'Julie Andrews'
     )
  );
```

---

## Problem 13
Obtain a list, in alphabetical order, of actors who've had at least 15 starring roles.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT actor.name
FROM actor 
  JOIN casting ON (actor.id = actorid)
WHERE ord = 1
GROUP BY actorid
HAVING COUNT(actorid) >= 15
ORDER BY actor.name;
```

**My Notes:**  
`GROUP BY` groups actors, and `HAVING COUNT()` filters those with 15 or more starring roles.

---

## Problem 14
List the films released in the year 1978 ordered by the number of actors in the cast, then by title.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT movie.title, COUNT(actorid)
FROM movie 
  JOIN casting ON (movie.id = movieid) 
WHERE yr = 1978
GROUP BY movieid
ORDER BY 
  COUNT(actorid) DESC, 
  movie.title;
```

**My Notes:**  
Use `COUNT(actorid)` to measure cast size, and sort by title in case of ties.

---

## Problem 15
List all the people who have worked with 'Art Garfunkel'.  

**My Solution:**

```sql
SELECT actor.name
FROM actor 
  JOIN casting ON (actor.id = actorid)
WHERE actor.name <> 'Art Garfunkel'
AND movieid IN
  (
  SELECT movieid
  FROM casting
  WHERE actorid = 
    (
    SELECT actor.id
    FROM actor
    WHERE actor.name = 'Art Garfunkel'
    )
  );
```

**My Notes:**  
Use *subqueries* to find all movie IDs featuring Art Garfunkel, then list all other actors in those movies.  
Exclude Art Garfunkel using `actor.name <> 'Art Garfunkel'`.
